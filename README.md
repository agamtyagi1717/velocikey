Shram Assignment:

Velocikey is an interactive online typing test game! Velocikey records your keypresses and calculates your Words-per-Minute (WPM) score. You can track your progress with fully responsive graphs that display your past scores. Surpass your personal best and get a confetti animation. Additionally, compete with other users for a Top-10 spot on the Leaderboard page.

IMPORTANT: When you first open the web app, please wait 45 seconds to a minute  and then refresh the page. This delay is necessary because the backend is hosted on the free tier of Render.com, which puts the server to sleep during periods of inactivity. You can still play the games without the backend server being active.
